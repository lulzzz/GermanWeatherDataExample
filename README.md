# GermanWeatherDataExample #

## Project ##

Going through a lot of pain has taught me, that you have to know about the capabilities and pitfalls of a technology, before putting it in production. These days it's all about "Big Data", but how well do technologies work, when we actually throw realistic data at it? What knobs have to be turned to make the technologies scale? 

In the project I want to benchmark [TimescaleDB], [Elasticsearch], [SQL Server] and [InfluxDB] on the 10 Minute Weather Data for Germany, which is available as Open Data in the [DWD Open Data](https://opendata.dwd.de/) portal. The dataset is available as CSV files and has a size of 25.5 GB.

The Project is a Work in Progress.
